# MyPythonJourney
Codes I work on during my journey in learning Python / django 

This is my practice work. Basically an amateuristic work. 

I am basically visualizing and imagining an e-learning project for my school. 
A project to be run in a local server to be used by the teachers in their respective classes.

I dream of building this kind of thing that shall provide:
  1. Learners' management
  2. Automatic Grading based on the activity of the learners
  3. Class scheduling / loading of teachers.
  4. Learners' supplemental activities - remedial or assignments/homeworks
  5. quizzes summatives, and periodical exams.
  6. etc...
